abstract: "The Canadian Grocery Price Dataset provides a comprehensive collection of product pricing and availability information from major grocery vendors across Canada. Designed to support research on affordability, convenience, and sustainability in grocery shopping, the dataset contains detailed entries on data collection dates, vendor names, product names, unit prices, sale statuses, stock statuses, and best-seller statuses. Data was collected through automated web scraping, ensuring consistency and temporal relevance, while preprocessing enhanced comparability across vendors. This dataset aims to inform consumer decision-making, vendor selection, and policy development by offering insights into pricing trends and vendor performance. The dataset is suitable for tasks such as predictive modeling, vendor scoring, and economic analysis, with potential applications in sustainability and food security studies. It is shared under an open-source license to encourage broad use and collaboration, with provisions for periodic updates and community contributions."

Extract of the questions from @gebru2021datasheets.
Datset from @grocery_data.


**Motivation**

1. *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    - The dataset was created to drive more competition and reduce collusion in the Canadian grocery sector. Some example tasks in mind were doing an economic analysis of pricing data, visualizing the price of making a standard sandwich at each of the grocers (200g white bread + 20g ham + 20g lettuce...) to find the cheapest vendor, and finding which grocer is generally the cheapest across all comparable product families.
    
2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    - This dataset was collected by Jacob Filipp for Project Hammer.
    
3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    - The project does not have an explicit funder.
    
4. *Any other comments?*
    - The dataset is still in a developing stage and is actively looking for people to contribute in it.

**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
	- Instances represent individual grocery products sold by Canadian vendors.
	
2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- There are 14 columns and 12117221 rows across 8 distinct vendors.
	
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- This dataset is a sample of products available from major Canadian grocery vendors with a focus on urban areas. Seasonal coverage is limited due to the timeframe of data collection.
	
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	- Each instance consists of the date and time of data collection, their current and previous prices, price per unit, sale/best-seller/stock status, distinct product id, vendor names, product names, units, and brand names.
	
5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No explicit label; the dataset is exploratory, though it supports predictions of affordability and vendor reliability.
	
6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- Certain entries lack unit sizes or prices due to scraping limitations.
	
7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
	- No explicit relationships, though vendor-product relationships and historical trends are implicit.
	
8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
	- Splits for exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and testing may be created based on temporal sequences.
	
9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Minor inconsistencies in product matching, redundant data due to a product being listed under multiple categories or being miscategorized, and missing data due to website scraping errors.
	
10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
	- The product information was scraped from vendor websites, but the dataset is self-contained.
	
11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No confidential data is present.
	
12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
	- No offensive data is present.
	
13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
	- No direct identification of sub-populations.
	
14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
	- No personal data is present.
	
15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No, it contains only public product and pricing data.

**Collection process**

1. *How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)?
