# Predicting Grocery Price Trends Using Bayesian Models

## Overview

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/simulated_data` contains the simulated grocery prices data.
-   `data/raw_data` does not contain the original data as the file is too large. The original dataset can be downloaded through 02-download_data.R
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, test, download, clean, explore, and model the data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of ChatGPT and the entire chat history is available in other/llm_usage/usage.txt.
